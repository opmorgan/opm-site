I’m Owen. I am a researcher interested in how psychology and neuroscience methods can give purchase on philosophical questions about perception, consciousness, and embodiment. In my PhD research, I study how action shapes perception, emotion, and cognition, using brain imaging and behavioral methods.

Currently, I am a PhD student in the [Experience and Cognition Lab](https://www.casasanto.com/) at Cornell University, where I work with Daniel Casasanto. Before that, I studied the cerebellum's role in cognition as a research assistant in [Cherie Marvel's lab](http://cheriemarvel.com/). As an undergraduate research assistant, I studied the neural correlates of visual consciousness under the mentorship of [Hal Blumenfeld](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/blumenfeld/) and [Sharif Kronemer](https://www.sharifkronemer.com/). I hold a BA in Liberal Arts from [St. John’s College](https://www.sjc.edu/), Annapolis.

When I am not doing science,  you might find me reading, dancing, or folding [origami](https://www.instagram.com/owen_foldin/).
