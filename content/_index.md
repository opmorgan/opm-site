Hi! I’m Owen. I study how action shapes perception, emotion, and cognition, using brain imaging and behavioral methods.

Currently, I am a PhD student in the Experience and Cognition Lab at Cornell University, where I work with Daniel Casasanto. Before that, I studied the cerebellum's role in cognition as a research assistant in Cherie Marvel's lab. As an undergraduate research assistant, I studied the neural correlates of visual consciousness under the mentorship of Hal Blumenfeld and Sharif Kronemer. I hold a BA in Liberal Arts from St. John’s College, Annapolis.

When I am not doing science,  you might find me reading, dancing, or folding origami.
