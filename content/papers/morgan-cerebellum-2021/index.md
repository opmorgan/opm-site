abstract: 'The cerebellum recognizes sequences from prior experiences and uses this
  information to generate internal models that predict future outcomes in a feedforward
  manner [Front Hum Neurosci 8: 475, 2014; Cortex 47: 137–44, 2011; Cerebellum 7:
  611–5, 2008; J Neurosci 26: 9107–16, 2006]. This process has been well documented
  in the motor domain, but the cerebellum’s role in cognitive sequencing, within the
  context of implicit versus explicit processes, is not well characterized. In this
  study, we tested individuals with cerebellar ataxia and healthy controls to clarify
  the role of the cerebellum sequencing using variations on implicit versus explicit
  and motor versus cognitive demands across five experiments. Converging results across
  these studies suggest that cerebellar feedforward mechanisms may be necessary for
  sequencing in the implicit domain only. In the ataxia group, rhythmic tapping, rate
  of motor learning, and implicit sequence learning were impaired. However, for cognitive
  sequencing that could be accomplished using explicit strategies, the cerebellar
  group performed normally, as though they shifted to extra-cerebellar mechanisms
  to compensate. For example, when cognitive and motor functions relied on cerebellar
  function simultaneously, the ataxia group’s motor function was unaffected, in contrast
  to that of controls whose motor performance declined as a function of cognitive
  load. These findings indicated that the cerebellum is not critical for all forms
  of sequencing per se. Instead, it plays a fundamental role for sequencing within
  the implicit domain, whether functions are motor or cognitive. Moreover, individuals
  with cerebellar ataxia are generally able to compensate for cognitive sequencing
  when explicit strategies are available in order to preserve resources for motor
  function.'
