abstract: While cerebellar ataxia (CA) is a neurodegenerative disease known for motor
  impairment, changes in mood have also been reported. A full account of neuropsychiatric
  symptomology in CA may guide improvements in treatment regimes, measure the presence
  and severity of sub-clinical neuropsychiatric disturbance symptomology in CA, and
  compare patient versus informant symptom recognition. Neuropsychiatric phenomena
  were gathered from CA patients with genetic and unknown etiologies and their informants
  (e.g., spouse or parent). Information was obtained from in-person interviews and
  the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Responses were converted
  to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) scores by consensus ratings.
  Patient NPI-Q scores were evaluated for symptom prevalence and severity relative
  to those obtained from healthy controls. Patient-informant NPI-Q score disagreements
  were evaluated. In this cohort, 95% of patients presented with at least one neuropsychiatric
  symptom and 51% of patients with three or more symptoms. The most common symptoms
  were anxiety, depression, nighttime behaviors (e.g., interrupted sleep), irritability,
  disinhibition, abnormal appetite, and agitation. The prevalence of these neuropsychiatric
  symptoms was uniform across patients with genetic versus unknown etiologies. Patient
  and informant symptom report disagreements reflected that patients noted sleep impairment
  and depression, while informants noted irritability and agitation. Neuropsychiatric
  disturbance is highly prevalent in patients with CA and contributes to the phenomenology
  of CA, regardless of etiology. Clinicians should monitor psychiatric health in their
  CA patients, considering that supplemental information from informants can help
  gauge the impact on family members and caregivers.
