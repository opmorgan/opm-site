abstract: Semi-structured interviews of patient accounts and caregiver, or informant,
  perspectives are a beneficial resource for patients suffering from diseases with
  complex symptomatology, such as cerebellar ataxia. The aim of this study was to
  identify, quantify, and compare the ways in which cerebellar ataxia patients’ and
  informants’ quality of life had changed as a result of living with ataxia. Using
  a semi-structured interview, responses were collected from patients and informants
  regarding motor, cognitive, and psychosocial variables. Responses were also collected
  from patients and informants to open-ended questions that were subsequently categorized
  into 15 quality of life themes that best represented changes experienced by the
  patients and informants. Ataxia patients and informants agreed as to the severity
  of posture/gait, daily activities/fine motor tasks, speech/feeding/swallowing, and
  oculomotor/vision impairment. It was also demonstrated that severity ratings for
  specific motor-related functions strongly correlated with corresponding functions
  within the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), and that this
  interview identified frequency associations between motor impairments and specific
  psychosocial difficulties, which could be useful for prognostic purposes. Overall,
  the information obtained from this study characterized the symptoms and challenges
  to ataxia patients and their caregivers, which could serve as a useful educational
  resource for those affected by ataxia, clinicians, and researchers.
