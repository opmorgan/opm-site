abstract: 'Abstract The full neural circuits of conscious perception remain unknown.
  Using a visual perception task, we directly recorded a subcortical thalamic awareness
  potential (TAP). We also developed a unique paradigm to classify perceived versus
  not perceived stimuli using eye measurements to remove confounding signals related
  to reporting on conscious experiences. Using fMRI, we discovered three major brain
  networks driving conscious visual perception independent of report: first, increases
  in signal detection regions in visual, fusiform cortex, and frontal eye fields;
  and in arousal/salience networks involving midbrain, thalamus, nucleus accumbens,
  anterior cingulate, and anterior insula; second, increases in frontoparietal attention
  and executive control networks and in the cerebellum; finally, decreases in the
  default mode network. These results were largely maintained after excluding eye
  movement-based fMRI changes. Our findings provide evidence that the neurophysiology
  of consciousness is complex even without overt report, involving multiple cortical
  and subcortical networks overlapping in space and time.'
