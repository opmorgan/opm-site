abstract: 'Background: The number of trinucleotide CAG repeats is inversely correlated
  with the age at onset (AAO) of motor symptoms in individuals with Spinocerebellar
  Ataxia type 3 (SCA 3) and may be responsible for 50%â€“60% of the variability in AAO.
  Drawing from a social determinants of health model, we sought to determine if educational
  attainment further contributes to the AAO and motor symptom progression of SCA 3.
  Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review in which twenty individuals met
  criteria for inclusion and had been seen by an ataxia specialist at our hospital
  between January 2005 and July 2019. AAO of motor symptoms and Scale for Assessment
  and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) scores were used as primary outcome measures. Results:
  Using a linear regression, we found that having greater CAG repeat length and greater
  than 16 years of education results in an earlier AAO. The importance of the CAG
  repeat length on AAO, however, is greater amongst individuals with lower education.
  Using a linear mixed model evaluating SARA score over time with AAO, we found that
  less than 16 years of education is associated with faster progression of the disease.
  Conclusion: In our group of SCA 3 patients, level of education correlated with both
  the AAO and SARA scores. Though our findings need to be confirmed with a larger
  cohort, our study suggests that level of education can have a strong influence on
  health outcomes in SCA 3 and possibly other groups of patients with ataxia.'
