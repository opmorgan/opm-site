abstract: Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne infectious disease in the United
  States. Post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) is a condition affecting 10â€“20% of patients
  in which symptoms persist despite antibiotic treatment. Cognitive complaints are
  common among those with PTLD, suggesting that brain changes are associated with
  the course of the illness. However, there has been a paucity of evidence to explain
  the cognitive difficulties expressed by patients with PTLD. This study administered
  a working memory task to a carefully screened group of 12 patients with well-characterized
  PTLD and 18 healthy controls while undergoing functional MRI (fMRI). A subset of
  12 controls and all 12 PTLD participants also received diffusion tensor imaging
  (DTI) to measure white matter integrity. Clinical variables were also assessed and
  correlated with these multimodal MRI findings. On the working memory task, the patients
  with PTLD responded more slowly, but no less accurately, than did controls. FMRI
  activations were observed in expected regions by the controls, and to a lesser extent,
  by the PTLD participants. The PTLD group also hypoactivated several regions relevant
  to the task. Conversely, novel regions were activated by the PTLD group that were
  not observed in controls, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. Notably, three activations
  were located in white matter of the frontal lobe. DTI measures applied to these
  three regions of interest revealed that higher axial diffusivity correlated with
  fewer cognitive and neurological symptoms. Whole-brain DTI analyses revealed several
  frontal lobe regions in which higher axial diffusivity in the patients with PTLD
  correlated with longer duration of illness. Together, these results show that the
  brain is altered by PTLD, involving changes to white matter within the frontal lobe.
  Higher axial diffusivity may reflect white matter repair and healing over time,
  rather than pathology, and cognition appears to be dynamically affected throughout
  this repair process.
