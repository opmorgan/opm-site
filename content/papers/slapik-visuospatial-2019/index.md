abstract: Poor visuospatial skills can disrupt activities of daily living. The cerebellum
  has been implicated in visuospatial processing, and patients with cerebellar injury
  often exhibit poor visuospatial skills, as measured by impaired memory for the figure
  within the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure task (ROCF). Visuospatial skills are an
  inherent aspect of the ROCF; however, figure organization (i.e., the order in which
  the figure is reconstructed by the participant) can influence recall ability. The
  objective of this study was to examine and compare visuospatial and organization
  skills in people with cerebellar ataxia. We administered the ROCF to patients diagnosed
  with cerebellar ataxia and healthy controls. The cerebellar ataxia group included
  patients that carried a diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia (any subtype), autosomal
  dominant cerebellar ataxia, or cerebellar ataxia with unknown etiology. Primary
  outcome measures were organization and recall performance on the ROCF, with supplemental
  information derived from cognitive tests of visuospatial perception, working memory,
  processing speed, and motor function. Cerebellar ataxia patients revealed impaired
  figure organization relative to that of controls. Figure copy was impaired in the
  patients, but their subsequent recall performance was normal, suggesting compensation
  from initial organization and copying strategies. In controls, figure organization
  predicted recall performance, but this relationship was not observed in the patients.
  Instead, processing speed predicted patientsâ€™ recall accuracy. Supplemental tasks
  indicated that visual perception was intact in the cerebellar ataxia group and that
  performance deficits were more closely tied to organization strategies than with
  visuospatial skills.
